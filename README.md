# IgniterJs

IgniterJs is javascript patching functionality for [Igniter](https://hexdocs.pm/igniter)

## Installation

IgniterJs can be added to an existing elixir project by adding it to your dependencies:

```elixir
{:igniter_js, "~> 0.4.6", only: [:dev, :test]}
```

## Status

We are still working on getting this ready for an initial release.

The initial codemods will be limited to specific transformations. This is not intended to
be a toolkit (yet) for writing any arbitrary transformation like `Igniter` is for `Elixir`.
We will likely provide a way to do this by the user providing rust code and using our tools
to hook it up to igniter.
